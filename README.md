SwiftLogging
============

This contains the early beginnings of an Swift version of my ECLogging library (http://github.com/elegantchaos/ECLogging)

I'm still exploring the possibilities at the moment, but the main priorities are to maintain the following from ECLogging:

- named, configurable channels
- alternate log handlers
- debug and non-debug channels and logging
- no runtime impact of debug logging or channels in release
- natural swift syntax

For no I don't intend to support Objective-C in this library - mixed language projects can continue to use ECLogging
